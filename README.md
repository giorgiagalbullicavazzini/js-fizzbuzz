# FizzBuzz

## Milestone 1

- Using the `for` statement, the code creates a loop and prints in console the numbers between 1 and 100;
- IF the number is a multiple of 3, the code prints "Fizz" instead;
- IF the number is a multiple of 5, the code prints "Buzz";
- IF the number is a multiple of 3 AND a multiple of 5, the code prints "FizzBuzz";

## Bonus 1

- Creation of a HTML container;
- Using the append() function, the code adds a HTML element to the container;
- This element contains the correct number or string;
- Using the `for` statement, the code adds all the numbers between 1 and 100 to the container;

## Bonus 2

- Using the same `for` statement, the code applies different styles to the elements;
- IF the element is a "Fizz" string, its background-color is green;
- ELSE IF the element is a "Fizz" string, its background-color is green;
- ELSE IF the element is a "FizzBuzz" string, its background-color is red;
- ELSE the background-color is blue.
